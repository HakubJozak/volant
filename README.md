# Volant

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HakubJozak/volant.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/HakubJozak/volant.svg?branch=ember)

An ad-hoc system for a volunteering organization (INEX-SDA)[http://www.inex-sda.cz] that is organizing workcamps in Czech Republic and
sending volunteers to similar organization across the globe. As all those NGOs have similar workflow, this 'placement tool' should be useful
for any other such institution without bigger changes.

Built on Rails 4 and Ember.
