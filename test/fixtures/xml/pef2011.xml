<descr_partner>ProjectThis project is run in the cooperation with the Estonian Fund for Nature (ELF). ELF s conservation work camps project, which is carried out from 1998, has two main goals. One is to carry out conservation work in nature parks and protected areas and second is to bring people closer to nature, to promote environment-friendly and sustainable lifestyle. International conservation work camps are important part of ELF s conservation holidays project. In international work camps ELF always involves local people to work alongside participants from other countries. The benefit in education, understanding, shared cultures is great, and the experience remembered by all. Also this kind of conservation work helps to raise awareness of local people about values of local nature and importance of old traditional land management.First part of the camp will take place in Luitemaa Nature Reserve known for its well preserved costal-meadows and sand dunes. The second part will be in Puhtu-Laelatu Nature Reserve known for its rich plant communities and birdlife.</descr_partner>

<descr_work>Luitemaa is one of the areas where Natterjack Toad (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natterjack_Toad ) was re-introduced in mid 2000s after dramatic decline of its Baltic population. To improve the breeding conditions of this extraordinary species of amphibian fine tuning of spawning bonds is carried out every year. The task will be removing vegetation from the costal ponds and preventing the spawning ponds from growing over.

<descr_partner>Project The aim of this camp is to help renovation works of the historical watermill Koesti. This watermill dating from the end of 18th century is an important object of heritage for the local community. The oldest part of the building existing at present was built in the second half of 19th century. In 1930 the watermill was made two-storied and on the river side the engineering for producing electric power was built. After the Second World War several changes have been made there. Today association managing the watermill put a lot of effort into developing it into a hydroelectric plant, which started to give first energy now. And this is a very important step for the local community which goes along with the general plan to raise the production use of energy from alternative sources in Estonia. At present such generating alternative energy projects have not been developed in Estonia yet to the noticeable extend, therefore Koesti Watermill is an important initiative which should be supported.</descr_partner>

<descr_work>The work will involve mainly cleaning up/ recovering of the hydro power station canal and the banks of Koesti creek. This means quite physical work in the water removing mud, stones, branches of trees, etc. Volunteers have to bring rubber boots. Also there may be some clearing up the green areas around the mill and occasionally simple conservation jobs in the building (e.g. cleaning the walls before painting). Volunteers will be working 7-8 hours per day 5 days a week under the supervision of local technical leader.</descr_work>

<descr_accomodation_and_food>The accommodation facilities will be quite simple: you will stay in the mill house in camp beds. Please bring your own sleeping bag. Please note that the shower is a self-made  summer shower  with the warmed water though. And there is dry toilet only. But you will have a good chance to try Estonian sauna on weekend. Simple traditional local food will be prepared by the hosts, volunteers will be asked to help cleaning and washing up. Possibility of making own food is limited.</descr_accomodation_and_food>

<descr_location_and_leisure>The project is located at the border of Viljandi, a town situated in South Estonia on Sakala Upland. Town of Viljandi with its 20,000 inhabitants is an independent unit of local authority and the centre of the county. As a culture town it is well known for its valued Culture Academy, Ugala Drama Theatre and the famous international Folk Music Festival (http://www.folk.ee) held yearly at the end of July. Viljandi lies 160 km from Tallinn, 98 km from Parnu and 80 km from Tartu. More information about Viljandi on www.viljandi.ee/?id=506 and www.viljandimaa.ee/turismiinfo/?lg=engLeisure timeThere are a lot of possibilities for leisure time activities as camp will take place in the town where one can find attractions for all tastes: sightseeing and museums, festivals, concerts, live music, pubs, etc. You can also spend time at Viljandi Lake and go swimming. Or simply stay at the mill having bonfire, barbeque and sauna with locals.</descr_location_and_leisure>

<descr_requirements>This camp is not suitable for volunteers allergic to different plants or hay. Be prepared for physical work. Please note rather simple washing facilities in this camp.

The schedule of the camp allows adults to act as volunteers like in any other voluntary camp (4-6 hours a day for practical tasks). Meanwhile children  work  as well, in the sense that they take part in the activities helping parents and sharing easy tasks with them. Local organisers supported by parents care about the children during the working activities, providing snacks, proposing games, etc. In the daily free time and in the days off group excursions will be suggested by the local hosts. Parents can join the camp in pair or alone with their children. The age of children is 3 to 13. Some English is necessary for parents in order to communicate among them and with the campleader. This camp follows positive experience of last five years.VenueIt is a long tradition for EstYES to organize international workcamps in co-operation with Kiidi Farm located in the Voru County in the South of Estonia. With the support of the state and local authorities the eco- and farm sustainable tourism has been developed in this area. Besides promoting the environmental tourism, this initiative supports rural development, which is an important issue for Estonia. Estonian Association of Farm Tourism has launched several projects, and Kiidi Farm, where the camp takes place, is one of them. It is run by the large Piho family with 8 kids of different age. More information on Kiidi Farm is on site www.kiidi.ee</descr_partner>

Today association managing the watermill put a lot of effort into developing it into a hydroelectric plant, which started to give first energy now. And this is a very important step for the local community which goes along with the general plan to raise the production use of energy from alternative sources in Estonia. At present such generating alternative energy projects have not been developed in Estonia yet to the noticeable extend, therefore Koesti Watermill is an important initiative which should be supported.</descr_partner>

<descr_work>The work will involve mainly cleaning up/ recovering of the hydro power station canal and the banks of Koesti creek.

<descr_accomodation_and_food>The accommodation facilities will be quite simple: you will stay in the mill house in camp beds. Please bring your own sleeping bag. Please note that the shower is a self-made  summer shower  with the warmed water though. And there is dry toilet only. But you will have a good chance to try Estonian sauna on weekend. Simple traditional local food will be prepared by the hosts, volunteers will be asked to help cleaning and washing up. Possibility of making own food is limited.</descr_accomodation_and_food>
