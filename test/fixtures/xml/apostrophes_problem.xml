Work: Supervised by an experienced mason, you will continue the conservation of the remains of the castle of the Earls of Comminges: clearing of the overgrowth, masonry, building of small stone walls. The site hosts several hundreds of visitors in the summer months. Furthermore you participate in the medieval show organised by Mr Marrot, president of the district council of Barousse: this show talks about the history of the valley. You will participate in 3 rehearsal sessions and one live performance, as extras.
Location: Bramevaque is a small rural village of 30 inhabitants, at the foot of the Pyrenees mountains which mark the border with Spain. The site offers beautiful landscapes and view points.
