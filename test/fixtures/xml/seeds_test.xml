WORK/PROJECT: SEEDS, will work again this year with our groups of volunteers in the natural protected reserve of Þórsmörk. Volunteers’ tasks in this project will be mainly focused on preparations of the area before the summer season as this is one of the most beautiful sites of the country and therefore very popular among local and foreign visitors, hikers and nature lovers. &#13;
SEEDS will support the administration of the reserve putting up the visitors’ area, the mountain huts and the housing facilities. We will get the houses up and running after the area is closed in the autumn; we will be cleaning the area, furbishing the huts and the common facilities. Work includes maintenance and renovation of window, door frames and panes that may be affected by the frost of the past winter. Other tasks include painting and retouching of the huts, preparation of the camping and outdoors area, arranging fences and general works in order to prepare the reserve.&#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will stay in the ranger’s huts and will sleep in bunk beds or mattresses on the floor. A warm sleeping bag is strongly recommended. Volunteers will receive food and be in charge of the different cooking and cleaning activities. &#13;
LOCATION: The Þórsmörk natural reserve is one of the most beautiful places in Iceland, surrounded by natural boundaries like mountains, ice caps and Glacier Rivers &amp; lagoons. The Þórsmörk area is bounded by Krossá River to the south, Markarfljót River to the west, Ljósá River to the north and the ice cap Mýrdalsjökull to the east. Þórsmörk is an idyllic place of exceptional meteorological conditions hidden in the embrace of glaciers and mountains and was actually a fjord from the ocean about 12.000 years ago. The weather here is also often known to be better and less windy than in the immediate surrounding areas - making it a great destination to go to when the weather is lousy elsewhere. The glacier lagoon here is very popular to visit as well.&#13;
Þórsmörk is a place of breathtaking landscapes and a fauna of great variety. It is the home of 170 seminiferous plants as well as a variety of trees, moss and fern. The main reason for the variety of plants and trees is probably attributed to the fact that the area has been exempt from sheep and horsegrazing for over 100 years - sheltering them from their apparent negative impact on the flora. &#13;
Þórsmörk is one of Iceland’s brightest pearls in the string of beautiful areas of the country, surrounded by rugged and beautiful mountains, glaciers and glacial rivers, decorated with small birch woods and silver lined with humming brooks. Locals also appreciate Þórsmörk very much and visit it frequently the whole year round. Few brooks and rivers have to be forded to get there.&#13;
Þórsmörk is famous for spectacular nature and is very popular to visit and go hiking. There are many hiking trails in Þórsmörk, one can hike inside the area or hike over the unique trail “Laugavegur” to Landmannalaugar. During summer many people begin the journey/trail/hiking or relax after the 2-3 days journey/trail/hiking from Landmannalaugar. There is also a special trail from Skógar, “Fimmvörðuháls” so it is a perfect place for nature lovers and those who enjoy being outdoors. &#13;
Þórsmörk is situated in the south of Iceland, about 160 km from Reykjavík, between 3 glaciers in a place of surreal beauty. For years, the only access to this wondrous place was by a powerful or altered jeep to cross the treacherous rivers, but that is no longer the case. &#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the official language in the camp; high proficiency is not a requirement.&#13;
TERMINAL: Closest International Airport: Keflavík (Reykjavík), KEF. Closest bus stop is Hvolsvöllur. SEEDS organises the “minibus option”, a shared transport from Reykjavík to the camps and vice-versa, which apart from being cheaper and more convenient, allows volunteers to meet fellow campers and have a relaxed trip, while stopping on the way for interesting and tourist sites.&#13;
SPECIAL REMARKS / EXTRAS: Participation fee EUR 80,- (Euros). Remote places located in natural reserved areas of extreme beauty. Guided hikes and free time activities in the area will be arranged for the volunteers.&#13;
* The name Þórsmörk means “the forest of Þór” or " Þór’s woods"&#13;

The tasks are varied and will depend on the weather conditions and sailing conditions as one of the working sites need to be reached by boat; Geirþjófsfjörður. Volunteers’ tasks will be mainly building and maintaining hiking trails and pathways in the area. Additional tasks may include putting up signs and descriptive information charts for the trails, clearing old oil tanks from the abandoned farm lands in Geirþjófsfjörður and general clearing of the coast line in both fjords, Arnarfjörður and Tálknafjörður. &#13;
&#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will be hosted in a local house; sleeping on mattresses on the floor; therefore bringing a warm sleeping bag is highly recommended. Food ingredients will be provided and a kitchen will be available, volunteers will share the duties of preparing and cooking meals. &#13;
&#13;
LOCATION: Bíldudalur and Tálknafjörður are small fishing towns, at Arnarfjörður and Tálknafjörður respectively; communities in the Icelandic western fjords, where the main trades are/were fishing and fish processing. However, during the last years and due to the introduction of the quota system in the Icelandic fishing sector, the towns lost their share in the fishing amounts to be caught and this has strongly hit the economy and living situation in the area, which will be one of the issues addressed during the workcamp. In the past years the emphasis on alternative industries has been more visible, similar to other fishing villages. This area in the south of the Western fjords is famed for its beautiful landscape and good weather with warm and sunny summers with gentle breezes, conditions which are hospitable for fishing, swimming, hiking and a variety of other activities.&#13;
Langibotn in Geirþjófsfjörður is one of the places where the story of Gísli Súrsson took place, which is one of the most famous Icelandic sagas. Although the saga is only preserved whole in later manuscripts, it was most likely written down in the early 13th century with action occurring between 940-980 A.D. Gisli Sursson's Saga is a classic outlaw saga that is centred on the internal struggles of Gisli, the saga's protagonist, a 10th century settler who ends up outlawed - that is, being declared a person who could be legally killed by anyone finding him - after he avenges the death of his blood brother. Differing from the typical Icelandic Saga, it uses the common theme of vengeance to divide loyalties within with family instead of strengthening familial bonds.&#13;
From Langibotn, you can walk up to the cliff Einhamar, where Gísli was killed. The vicinity offers a variety of interesting places to explore and hiking and mountain climbing are popular. The sheer beauty of the region attracts people and tourism has started to play an increasing role recently. The distance from Reykjavik is 475 km (7 hours drive) by the Whale Bay tunnel but only 300 km via Stykkisholmur and by the ferry to Brjánslaekur. It is perhaps one of Iceland's most remote areas. &#13;
Bíldudalur and Tálknafjörður are located in the Icelandic Western Fjords, which are too often missed by visitors due to its distance (real and perceived) from Route 1, the circle road, and from other population centers. The West Fjords are a mass of fjords, mountains and isolated villages on spits of lands surrounded by water and mountains. The area includes its own glacier, the magnificent, remote Hornstrandir and Europe's westernmost point of land at Látrabjarg, there, millions of birds nest in the cliffs making it a must for bird watchers. &#13;

There is a camping site in the area that has to be fixed and marked properly to prevent unnecessary damage to the nature. Volunteers will also have the opportunity to discover new hiking or tracking pathways and mark them. In the area there is an old house that has become a danger hazard; the house needs to be demolished so it can be built up in its original form; depending on the advance of the mentioned tasks, this first group will start demolishing the house and taking the different materials apart in order to be taken to the recycling centres.&#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will be hosted in a local mountain house; sleeping on mattresses on the floor; bringing a warm sleeping bag is highly recommended. Food ingredients will be provided and a kitchen will be available, volunteers will share the duties of preparing and cooking meals. &#13;
LOCATION: The Icelandic highlands or “the interior” are a true pearl to all nature lovers and outdoors people. It is accessible all year round on 4WD cars and most Highland routes involve crossing unbridged rivers.&#13;
If volunteers really want to get away from it all, the interior of Iceland is like nothing you have ever experienced. The mountainous centre of the island, with its rocky deserts, craggy mountain peaks, ice caps, volcanoes, hidden valleys and hot springs, is an awesome and untouched wilderness. Lake Hvítárvatn on the Kjölur highland road glints icy-blue at the foot of the Langjökull glacier, and in the barren black sands of Sprengisandur the arctic river beauty blooms bright magenta. &#13;
The interior was long all but inaccessible. Outlaws hid out for years at a time in the highlands, rustling sheep and keeping away from law-abiding citizens, while folklore tells of both natural and supernatural beings who lay in wait for unwary highland travellers. &#13;
Travellers between north and south sometimes had to cross the highlands: for instance for the assembly of Alþingi (parliament) each summer, delegates had to ride from every corner of the country to Þingvellir in the southwest, journeys across the interior were never undertaken lightly; such travel was risky and lives were often lost. Today the interior is crossed by two mountain roads, via Kjölur and Sprengisandur, which are only open in summer, after the snow has thawed in spring. &#13;
Volunteers will be staying close to the glacier Hofsjökull and near to the rivers Hvítá and Þjórsá. The mountains in the area -reach up to 1500m- were formed during a volcanic eruption in the later part of the ice age. The area is still dynamic and great geothermal activity takes place in the surroundings. The environment is very diverse, both in shape and colour. The mountains are very weathered and have very little continuous growth, as the forces of nature, like glaciers, water flow, ice bursts etc. have been fast working in these mountain highlands.&#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the official language in the camp, high proficiency is not required.&#13;
STUDY THEME: Environmental messenger in the project. S/he will be in charge of delivering ecological and global education messages to both, International volunteers and local hosts. S/he will arrange and organise few activities that intend to raise awareness and to encourage the participants to undertake simple but easy-to-implement actions which will affect the way we use our resources and we deal with the environment and the world we live in.&#13;

Most of the project will be dedicated to coastline cleaning. The island is located not far out of the capital’s coast and sea currents bring considerable amounts of trash to its shores. &#13;
Volunteers will also play a crucial role for the preparation of the Viðeyjarhátið, the island’s festival to commemorate the summer solstice; the festival will be held on the weekend on June 27 &amp; 28th. Depending on the advance of the project, volunteers may have other possible tasks as maintenance and marking of hiking paths or bicycle trails, help in summer events, putting up of signs in noteworthy places; as works on common and green recreational areas, gardening and painting works, etc.&#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will be lodged in a local house, sleeping on mattresses on the floor; a warm sleeping bag is suggested. If wished, some volunteers may stay in tents. Food ingredients will be provided and volunteers will share common duties as cooking the meals, among others. &#13;
LOCATION: Viðey or “Wood Island” is the largest island of the Kollafjord Bay (1,7 km²) with its highest point rising 32 m above sea level. It is divided by a short isthmus and the western part is called The West Island (Vesturey). The large part, with the church and Viðeyjarstofa (Viðey House), is called The Home Island (Heimaey) and the south-eastern part is called The East Island (Austurey). The island is of volcanic origins and was formed about 2 million years ago; several spots on the island depict beautiful basaltic columns, while it is well vegetated and boggy in places. About 156 species of higher plants have been found on the island and the avifauna is highly interesting. At least 30 species of breeding birds have been counted, the most common ones are eiders and the lesser black backed gull. Archaeological excavations have disclosed the fact, that the island was inhabited already in the 10th century. In the 12th century a church was built on the island and in 1225 an Augustine monastery was established there, which was a centre for pilgrimage in the Middle Ages until it was abolished in 1539 after the reformation had started in Iceland.&#13;
The Viðeyjarstofa house was built in 1755 and is thus the first construction made of stone and cement in the country. The church was consecrated in 1774 and is the second oldest one still standing. The island became the seat of the first Icelandic treasurer and later the first Icelandic sub-governor, Mr Skuli Magnusson. In the beginning of the 20th century the country's first harbour for ocean going vessels was built on the eastern part of the island and a hamlet developed there. The last inhabitant left it in 1943, when the harbour of Reykjavik had taken over. &#13;
There are hiking and cycling paths around the island and there is no motor traffic allowed. It also inhabits intriguing sculptural art work, amongst them all nine pairs of basalt pillars that comprise Richard’s Serra’s work Áfangar and Yoko Ono’s peace column. The island has been subject of interest lately, regarding the potential moving of open air folk-museum Arbaejarsafn to the island.&#13;
Other places of interest on Viðey are related to archaeological research, the village. At the eastern end of the island is the site of the abandoned fishing village and Viðeyjarnaust, at the southwest of the island, it is a memorial to the twenty men who lost their lives when the cutter Ingvar sank off Viðey in 1906. Dramatic formations of columnar basalt may be seen on the shore. &#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the official language in the camp; high proficiency is not a requirement.&#13;
STUDY THEME: Environmental messenger in the project. S/he will be in charge of delivering ecological and global education messages to both, International volunteers and local hosts; organising few activities on topics related to environment, nature protection and sustainability. &#13;

Volunteers will be mainly working on reforestation tasks; planting trees will be the main job while others may include follow up on survival and growth of trees planted in the past. &#13;
Additional task, depending on advance of the reforestation project, will be cleaning up the coastline in the area, as one of the biggest pollution issues in the area is the litter brought to the shore due to sea currents that even bring timber as far as from Siberia. During the volunteers stay they may be helping the locals preparing for the celebration of Kátir dagar (Happy days), a festival held in the town every July!&#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will be lodged in the local sports centre, sleeping on mattresses on the floor. Therefore a warm sleeping bag is highly suggested. Within the facilities of the centre volunteers will have a kitchen to cater themselves. Food will be provided and meals will be then prepared/cooked by volunteers. Luckily there will be access to the nearby local swimming pool and sport centre with top-quality facilities. &#13;
LOCATION: Þórshöfn* is a compact, busy little town at the base of the Langanes Peninsula in the North-East of Iceland, located at the Þistilfjörður. The entire district (including farms and the village of Bakkafjörður) has 479 Inhabitants (01.12.2007) and they base their livelihood on fishing, fish processing and commerce serving the surrounding rural farming area. It is probably the best place in Iceland to experience what it is like to live in an isolated village almost 60 miles, 100 km from the next village. Around 400 people live in the village itself and the distance from the capital is 629 km by the Whale Bay tunnel.&#13;
The Langanes peninsula is the last word in Icelandic remoteness and it narrows like a spear point toward northeast and its fowling cliffs have been and still are a means of sustenance for those, who live there. Nowadays, the area is very sparsely populated. Most farms have been abandoned during the last few decades. Some of the remaining farmers tend the breeding colonies of the eiders and collect their down, clean it and sell at high prices.&#13;
Nature lovers often spend days on end at the densely populated bird cliffs watching gannets, puffins, guillemots, brunnich's guillemots, black guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes, fulmars etc. One of the best places for the observation of the gannets is Cliff Storikarl off the bird cliff Skoruvikurbjarg. Other bird species colonise different parts of the peninsula, such as the arctic terns near the farm Ytra-Lon. &#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the language in the camp, but high proficiency is not a requirement.&#13;
STUDY THEME: Environmental messenger in the project. S/he will be in charge of delivering ecological and global education messages to both, International volunteers and local hosts through organised activities as workshops, presentations, simulations, discussions, games on topics related to environment, nature protection and sustainability as use of resources, globalisation, millennium development goals, global warming, fair trade, recycling, consumption, etc. &#13;
TERMINAL: Closest International Airports: Keflavík (Reykjavík), KEF and Akureyri; nearest domestic airport is Þórshöfn (THO), while the closest bus stop is in town. SEEDS organises the “minibus option”, a shared transport from Reykjavík to the camps and vice-versa, which apart from being cheaper and more convenient, allows volunteers to meet fellow campers and have a relaxed trip, while stopping on the way for interesting and tourist sites.&#13;
&#13;
SPECIAL REMARKS / EXTRAS: Participation fee EUR 120,- (Euros). Free entrance to the local modern swimming pool, sports centre facilities. Excursions will be arranged by the local contacts.&#13;
&#13;
* The name Þórshöfn is the harbor of Þór. Þór is the thunder god. His wife’s name is Sif. Þór is the son of Odin the most powerful god. Odin’s horse Sleipnir put one of its eight feet down in Ásbyrgi, hence the horseshoes shape. It is a must to visit the ponds in Ásbyrgi on your way to Dettifoss.&#13;

These projects may include traditional turf wall construction, stone wall construction, path building and maintenance, lupine control, preparation of an organic vegetable garden and cleaning of the coast line.&#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will stay within the reserve and will sleep either in bunk beds or on mattresses. A warm sleeping bag is strongly recommended. &#13;
LOCATION: The heritage and nature conservation centre and its reserve are located in a very isolated area in the East of Iceland, far from any urban centre; volunteers shall be aware of the location remoteness and its extreme natural beauty. There are no public transportation services to the closest town and entertainment alternatives are connected to the gorgeous nature, walking and hiking journeys during the free time, boat trips organised by our hosts and the creativity of the group. This project is adequate for volunteers enjoying isolated places with splendid nature and looking for peaceful surroundings as the quietness of the area. The site is bounded by the sea and High Mountains reaching up to 600 meters in height.&#13;
The reserve is managed as a conservation site for environmental education and sustainable tourism; hosting a number of environmentally important flora and fauna including one of Iceland’s largest colonies of Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea), 600m sea cliffs hosting significant numbers of nesting sea birds (including Puffin, Kittiwake and Fulmar) and is home to the elusive arctic fox. There are at least 150 species of plants, 47 bird species and the four Icelandic mammals many of which you will see whilst working within the reserve.&#13;
The East Fjords are a magnificent landscape of long, narrow fjords, steep mountains and jagged peaks. This is one of the oldest regions of Iceland, which was shaped by glaciers in the Ice Age. Glacial action uncovered magma chambers which had been about 3 km beneath the surface, where zeolites had formed. These beautiful rocks can now be seen along the coast. The more remote fjords are now mostly uninhabited, but hiking is popular through these deserted regions of high mountain ridges and verdant valleys. Off the shore are grassy islands, which can be visited by boat. The East Fjords have many natural harbours, and this led to the development of fishing villages in the 19th century, most of which still exist. These seaside communities have a special charm, and many of them have town festivals every year. &#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the language in the camp; high proficiency is not a requirement.&#13;
STUDY THEME: Environmental messenger in the project. S/he will be in charge of delivering ecological and global education messages to both, International volunteers and local hosts through organised activities as workshops, presentations, simulations, discussions, games on topics related to environment, nature protection and sustainability as use of resources, globalisation, millennium development goals, global warming, fair trade, recycling, consumption, etc. &#13;
The group will have the opportunity to learn about the environment and culture of Iceland through working on the reserve; the centre and its staff hold a wealth of information which will be available.&#13;
TERMINAL: Closest International Airports: Keflavík – Reykjavík (KEF) and domestic airports is Egilsstaðir (EGS). SEEDS organises the “minibus option”, a shared transport from Reykjavík to the camps and vice-versa, which apart from being cheaper and more convenient, allows volunteers to meet fellow campers and have a relaxed trip, while stopping on the way for interesting and tourist sites.&#13;
SPECIAL REMARKS / EXTRAS: Participation/contribution fee of EUR 150,- (Euros). Remote places located in natural reserved areas of extreme beauty. Guided hikes and free time activities in the area will be arranged for SEEDS volunteers. The group will have the opportunity to learn about the environment and culture of Iceland through working on the reserve; the centre and its staff hold a wealth of information which will be available.&#13;

Volunteers will specifically continue working at the old whaling station in Suðureyri. Volunteers’ work will mainly be focused on renovation and reconstruction works in the old buildings and former facilities of the whaling station, and continue the work of the last 2 years by other groups of SEEDS volunteers.&#13;
After being abandoned for more than half a century, some of the buildings have collapsed and the ruins are spread all around in the area. The main aim in the longer-term of the project is to rebuild the facilities and have an art gallery and historic exhibit about the whaling station, whaling in Iceland, its history and the different developments throughout the last 2 centuries on the topic as its impact in the local socio-economical circumstances.&#13;
The group will be divided in different teams and tasks will be rotated. One of the sub-groups will be in charge of catching the fish, collecting berries and gathering the ingredients as Icelanders used to cater themselves some decades ago when the country and this region in particular were very isolated and transport of “foreign” goods and products was almost non-existent. Fishing gear, boat, as needed equipment and training will be provided by our local hosts. In case of unsuccessful journeys to “catch our food”, we will have at our disposal a boat to sail to the nearest convenience store, on the other side of the fjord in the town of Tálknafjörður.&#13;
ACCOMMODATION &amp; FOOD: Volunteers will be hosted in a local house at Suðureyri, will sleep on bunk beds in shared rooms and are asked to bring their own sleeping bags. Electricity will be available for short periods of time a day (with a diesel generator), but a fully equipped kitchen running on gas is at disposal. Geothermal hot pots are easy to be reached by boat on the opposite side of the fjord, as the swimming pool, convenience store and additional facilities in the town of Tálknafjörður. &#13;
LOCATION: Suðureyri is located in the district of Tálknafjarðarhreppur in the Icelandic Western Fjords. Tálknafjörður is the main and only “considerable-sized” town in the district with around 300 inhabitants. Suðureyri, on the opposite –western- side of the fjord was the location of an old whaling station built at the end of the 19th century by Norwegian whale hunters, which was on and off operation for around 50 years until the year 1939 and is now deserted. During its busiest times around 110 people lived and worked at the station. Today the great buildings are grand monuments of times past. Nearby is the valley of Suðureyri, Suðureyrardalur, the biggest valley on the south-west side of Tálknafjörður.&#13;
The town of Tálknafjörður, sometimes referred to as Sveinseyri, lies near the head of the Tálknafjörður, the fjord, and the main sources of income are fishing and farming. It differs from the other so-called Western Fjörds in the fact that there is geothermal activity and the water is used for heating and in the swimming pool. Tálknafjörður is located around 400 Km from the Icelandic capital Reykjavík and around 160 Km from Ísafjörður, the biggest town in the Western Fjords. &#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the official language in the camp; high proficiency is not a requirement.&#13;
STUDY THEME: Environmental messenger in the project. S/he will be in charge of delivering ecological and global education messages to both, International volunteers and local hosts; organising few activities on topics related to environment, nature protection and sustainability. &#13;
TERMINAL: Closest International Airports: Keflavík – Reykjavík (KEF) and closest bus stop is in the town of Tálknafjörður. SEEDS organises the “minibus option”, a shared transport from Reykjavík to the camps and vice-versa, which apart from being cheaper and more convenient, allows volunteers to meet fellow campers and have a relaxed trip, while stopping on the way for interesting and tourist sites.&#13;
EXTRAS/SPECIAL REMARKS: Participation fee EUR 150,- (Euros). Excursions in the area will be arranged for volunteers by our local host. Please expect plenty of Icelandic cod and haddock in the menu and loads of fun sailing and catching your own food!! &#13;

We will be working in a very practical, sometimes repetitive way, preparing for the marathon as well as working during the marathon run itself. Before the events, SEEDS volunteers will be engaged in preparing the packages for the local and international runners, those packages are delivered at registration and contain among others the shirts and numbers for each participant, detailed information about the marathon and the city. Volunteers will prepare the sports hall were registrations are taken and help during the registration itself. On the run day, diverse tasks in different locations along the circuit will be performed.&#13;
As volunteers will work during the weekend the marathon takes place, they will have two days off during the regular working/business days (Monday to Friday). The Reykjavík Marathon (Reykjavíkur Maraþon) will take place on August 22nd. The working load will be heavier in the last days prior to the weekend and during the weekend itself. Volunteers will work before, during and after the marathon (one day), helping in the many different activities related to the preparation and execution as re-arranging all again, once the marathon is over. &#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will be lodged in a building located in the centre of Reykjavík, sharing a large room and sleeping on mattresses on the floor. Volunteers are expected to cook their own meals, ingredients will be provided and the common tasks will be shared fairly.&#13;
LOCATION: Reykjavík*, the Icelandic capital, has been called Europe’s hottest capital. Slick advertising campaigns have championed the city’s famed nightlife. But there is more to Reykjavik than pubs and clubs. Reykjavík held the prestigious title European City of Culture in the year 2000; a welcome recognition of the energetic and colourful cultural life of the capital. &#13;
The world’s northernmost capital bridges the Atlantic, between Europe and North America, is framed by the majestic Mt. Esja and the blue waters of Faxaflói Bay. The population of the city is about 120,000 (40% of Iceland’s population) in the metropolitan area and 200,000 (60% of Iceland’s inhabitants) including its suburbs. It is growing steadily and 45% is younger than 30 years old. Reykjavík is a dynamic, modern city in harmony with beautiful nature, using renewable energy sources, geothermal power and glacial rivers. It is an International city with a lively Cosmopolitan cultural scene. &#13;
Visitors experience easily the pure energy at the heart of Iceland's capital- whether from the boiling thermal energy underground, the natural green energy within the city and around it, or the lively culture and fun-filled nightlife. Reykjavik is spread across a peninsula with a panoramic view of the mountains and the Atlantic on almost all sides. In the summer, one can sit by the harbour at midnight and watch the sun dip slightly below the horizon before it makes its way up again.&#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the official language in the camp; high proficiency is not a requirement.&#13;
STUDY THEME: Environmental messenger in the project. S/he will be in charge of delivering ecological and global education messages to both, International volunteers and local hosts through organised activities. We intend to raise awareness and to encourage the participants to undertake simple but easy-to-implement actions which will affect the way we deal with the environment and the world we live in.&#13;
TERMINAL: Closest International Airport: Keflavík (Reykjavík), KEF. Closest bus terminal in Reykjavík.&#13;
EXTRAS: Participation fee EUR 150,- (Euros). Excursions and free time activities in the area will be arranged for the volunteers. Passes to access free of charge the city’s seven geothermal swimming pools and beach and the chance to live the northernmost capital city in the world and one of the smallest! &#13;
* The name Reykjavík means “smoky bay”: Given by the first settlers that arrived to the area due to the high geothermal activity and the constant rise of steam out of the hot springs around.&#13;

There is a camping site in the area that has to be fixed and marked properly to prevent unnecessary damage to the nature. Volunteers will also have the opportunity to discover new hiking or tracking pathways and mark them. In the area there is an old house that has become a danger hazard; the house needs to be demolished so it can be built up in its original form; depending on the advance of the mentioned tasks and the work done by a group of SEEDS volunteers in June, this group will start/continue/finish demolishing the house and taking the different materials apart in order to be taken to the recycling centres.&#13;
ACCOMMODATION: Volunteers will be hosted in a local mountain house; sleeping on mattresses on the floor; bringing a warm sleeping bag is highly recommended. Food ingredients will be provided and a kitchen will be available, volunteers will share the duties of preparing and cooking meals. &#13;
LOCATION: The Icelandic highlands or “the interior” are a true pearl to all nature lovers and outdoors people. It is accessible all year round on 4WD cars and most Highland routes involve crossing unbridged rivers.&#13;
If volunteers really want to get away from it all, the interior of Iceland is like nothing you have ever experienced. The mountainous centre of the island, with its rocky deserts, craggy mountain peaks, ice caps, volcanoes, hidden valleys and hot springs, is an awesome and untouched wilderness. Lake Hvítárvatn on the Kjölur highland road glints icy-blue at the foot of the Langjökull glacier, and in the barren black sands of Sprengisandur the arctic river beauty blooms bright magenta. &#13;
The interior was long all but inaccessible. Outlaws hid out for years at a time in the highlands, rustling sheep and keeping away from law-abiding citizens, while folklore tells of both natural and supernatural beings who lay in wait for unwary highland travellers. &#13;
Travellers between north and south sometimes had to cross the highlands: for instance for the assembly of Alþingi (parliament) each summer, delegates had to ride from every corner of the country to Þingvellir in the southwest, journeys across the interior were never undertaken lightly; such travel was risky and lives were often lost. Today the interior is crossed by two mountain roads, via Kjölur and Sprengisandur, which are only open in summer, after the snow has thawed in spring. &#13;
Volunteers will be staying close to the glacier Hofsjökull and near to the rivers Hvítá and Þjórsá. The mountains in the area -reach up to 1500m- were formed during a volcanic eruption in the later part of the ice age. The area is still dynamic and great geothermal activity takes place in the surroundings. The environment is very diverse, both in shape and colour. The mountains are very weathered and have very little continuous growth, as the forces of nature, like glaciers, water flow, ice bursts etc. have been fast working in these mountain highlands.&#13;
LANGUAGE: English will be the official language in the camp, high proficiency is not required.&#13;
