The center was built after the Second World War as a sign of hope and of reconciliation between people, thanks to the voluntary work of many young men and women. A resident group still lives at Agape throughout the year, and the dimensions of community and voluntary service remain central. The center is an important point of reference in Italian Protestantism, a place of education and development, theological exploration, political engagement, of acceptance and validation of differences. Every year many people, with different religious, cultural, political background, and of different age, come to Agape to discuss and to be challenged, to get to know themselves and each other and to exchange experiences around a particular theme. Depending on whom the international group is targeted at, people at the Center generally speak in Italian, English, German, French and Spanish, thus, it is advisable to speak one of the above mentioned languages, or at least try to learn a few words before setting off for the camp. Please visit: www.agapecentroecumenico.org to see which are the activity programmes.</descr_partner><descr_work>The work camp will support the activities of AGAPE when a number of guests have meetings on issues of political, social, cultural and religious interest. Volunteers will help in the following areas: kitchen (preparing food); dishes (laying and cleaning the tables, dishwasher),  cleaning (WC and rooms), maintenance work, bar tending, outdoor (snow). During your stay, Agape will organize one teenager camp and the rest of time there will be guest groups.  You re not ask to participate into the organization of the camps for kids and teenagers or to take care about the kids: there s a specific group of people, called staff, that has been working on it all year long. But your work in kitchen or cleaning or maintenance or bar or servizio will be very import for those camps in order to work outGames, discussions and outings can be organized during free time. Programmed activities (especially in the evening) are most of the time open to volunteers, as long as they do not clash with work commitments, and there will be group discussions, games and ice skating nights organized. Prali is quite up in the mountains, so there will be lot of snow and ice around and you will be able to go for skiing in your free day or just enjoy the snow with the other volunteers.</descr_work><descr_accomodation_and_food>Usually the workcampers will be host in 3-4 bed bedrooms. Toilets are in common on the floor. The meal are typical Italian Mediterranean and there s a vegetarian alternative for those who require it, as well as for any specific allergies. It is possible to use a washing machine. The place is beautiful but really isolated, though you will stay together with many international participants to the meetings of AGAPE.</descr_accomodation_and_food><descr_location_and_leisure>-</descr_location_and_leisure><descr_requirements>-</descr_requirements><airport>TRN</airport><station>-</station><numvol_m>4</numvol_m><numvol_f>4</numvol_f><max_vols_per_country>2</max_vols_per_country><max_teenagers>0</max_teenagers><max_national_vols>2</max_national_vols><lat_project>44.8888138</lat_project><lng_project>7.0517416</lng_project><notes></notes><lat_station></lat_station><lng_station></lng_station><bi_tri_multi>0</bi_tri_multi></project></projects></projectform>
