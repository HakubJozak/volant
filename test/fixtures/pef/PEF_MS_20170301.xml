We hosted a workcamp last year “summer at the beach”.</descr_partner><descr_work>The Urban Art Summer Camp is for 9-13 year olds, looking for interesting and social activities during the summer. Objectives for the ”Urban art” camp are to inspire the pupils to create art and other projects that are suitable to display in public places. You will work with creative methods as painting, graffiti, sculpturing, lyrics and also bring your own ideas into play. As The ”nature school” is a partner in the work camp, you might be inspired to use the nature in the artwork during the week. Materials and support from the “nature school” will be available. We are close to the beach, so water may also be part of the creations. 

You will guide and help young participants with designing and completing projects that, in the end of the camp, will be exhibited in public places such as schools, on the beach, bus stops etc. 
The purpose is to develop the participants´ creative thinking , create visual experiences for the public and to start and complete projects, all in a social environment.

Our primary goal is to improve the youth culture in our city as well as the area surrounding it. We achieve this goal by seeking out artists (musicians as well as dancers, painters, sculptors etc.) that show an alternative side of the youth culture. This culture we are trying to portrait is almost non-existent in our region, not because it is bad, but simply because most artists choose to go for the bigger cities, where it is easier to find an audience. We have proved the sceptics wrong with every event, where great turnouts create amazing possibilities for a heightened understanding of culture in the youth, but also the possibility for new friendships and a betterment of social interaction is striking during our events. We, the persons running Subhuset, have experienced what volunteer work can do, how it can put smiles upon a face, and we wish for everyone to experience this, so we never close our doors for anyone with a good idea. It is all about helping each other.

 Subhuset Holstebro is located on in an old slaughterhouse factory. The raw cement floors and cold walls proved to be an excellent canvas on which we are creating a real, professional art/music house, with everything it needs.

The Work Camp project in which the volunteers will be participating will take place in the 2017 annual City Festival of Holstebro. In the week before the City Festival, we will give the volunteers free hands for creating a building in our so-called “Shady Town”, which is a part of a cooperation between Subhuset Holstebro and several international artists. Cabaret, singing, dancing, visual art-performances and theatre will revive the old Slaughterhouse in a matter that will be true to the general aesthetic of the place, but not everything will be about machinery, killing of animals and blood. The project will engage the volunteers in all sorts of practical work, such as building a part of our Shady Town, but everything in between will be covered. During the day, kids and childs at heart will participate in workshops which we will develop alongside the volunteers. A mentionable workshop idea is “cardboard wars”, where the people of Holstebro will create buildings and armors of cardboard, which will end with a massive battle where thousands of bits and pieces of cardboard will fly though the air. 

This project is a great opportunity for anyone interested in culture. If a volunteer should happen to be a musician, there will be a great opportunity for an audience at the “Bloody Cabaret Open Mic”, where anyone who wants, whether they have a story to tell, a song to sing or a melody to play can get on stage.

Our Shady Town building will function as a “bodega” during the evenings, where volunteers as well as the youth of Subhuset will host an innovative bar-experience. All profits will go towards Subhuset, so that we can create even more amazing events for the youth of our area.</descr_partner><descr_work>As mentioned earlier, a lot of the work will be practical. There won’t be much heavy lifting, but as a volunteer, you will be using your hands a lot. The main thing you will need to bring for our Work Camp, is your creative mind. Nothing during this week is written in stone, so if the volunteer group comes up with an amazing idea, we as hosts will do everything we can to come up with the resources to make it happen. 

Work in the week up to the Festival Week will be from 8 or 10 in the morning to 15 in the afternoon. During this time the volunteer group will take part in creating a wonderful atmosphere in the Shady Town.

Work during the Festival Week will be very different. Some days it will be like the previous week. Some days it will be from midday to midnight, with 2-3 hours of free time for dinner and recreational activities. We will make sure, that no one will take part in exhausting work, and the volunteers will have plenty of breaks during the day. 

The purpose of the project is to reveal and create new forms of culture. Through this project, we will show the city, the country, and the world, that just because a town as 50.000 people in it that doesn’t mean, that 1.000.000 new ideas and ways of looking of culture aren’t right there, present in the heart of the city.</descr_work><descr_accomodation_and_food>Sleeping facilities:
During your 20 day stay, as a volunteer, you will stay in our City Camping site on the Slaughterhouse grounds along with the artists that will perform and create during the festivities. We will arrange for large tents or huts in which you will be sleeping. Special requests regarding not wanting to sleep in the same hut as others will need to be mentioned in the motivational letter. Bring a sleeping bag, a pillow, and sheets. 

Food:
We will arrange for 1-3 meals a day. If only 1 or 2, we will set up a kitchen in order for you to go grocery shopping (right across the street), so that you can cook for each other. 

Kitchen + bathroom facilities: 
We will arrange either for an outdoor kitchen or make one inside our facilities (also at the slaughterhouse). We will arrange for bathroom facilites.</descr_accomodation_and_food><descr_location_and_leisure>If you decide to spend 20 days in Holstebro, then we can guarantee that you will not regret it. The Danish summers are always wonderful, and in this time, the city will be full of life and light. Holstebro is a large municipal with an exciting city center with loads of shops, restaurants and bars as well as an astonishing art museum. We will provide the volunteers with ideas for places to see, and bikes so they can go there. Nothing is really far from anything in Holstebro, and the Slaughterhouse and Camping Site are close to the heart of the city.</descr_location_and_leisure><numvol_m>7</numvol_m><numvol_f>7</numvol_f><max_vols_per_country>2</max_vols_per_country><max_teenagers>0</max_teenagers><max_national_vols>2</max_national_vols><lat_project>0</lat_project><lng_project>0</lng_project><notes>Most of the time, you will be working outdoors (if a hard rain falls we will figure out a way to move our work elsewhere or cover it up). There isn’t much need for previous experience with manual labor. We only ask that you take with you common sense, patience and a willingness to be overbearing with the many different types of people in your work camp group, but also with the artists that will surround the project. 

Also, if you bring along something decorative (a lightbulb, a poster, a folding chair etc.) that will definitely help us in creating a truly unique part of Shady Town.

You need to be more than 18 years old. You can read more about the school here: http://www.brenderuphojskole.dk/filer/english.htm
 
For the last many years, Brenderup have hosted work camps that have supported the building process of Brenderup environmental friendly buildings. We have made the straw bale house, a big culture and music hall, the ellipse-shaped “lotus house”. The treetop shelter, the ‘’climb around the world boulder climbing walls, an historic and culture play park. An organic fitness center in our garden, where nature is used instead of artificial machine equipment. Last camp completed an artistic brick laying camp, where we were decorating a rather big yard with old Celtic sings and patterns. We also did work with city gardening.
 
This year the work will try to incorporate former year’s ideas and concept of the last couple of years – building sustainable.
We call it our Off Grid House. The off grid house has been build during the spring this year. It is a house which is producing – everything – within its own walls. The only outside energy which is brought in to the house is 3 kubic meter of wood in a year for heating. 
The workcamp participants will learn how such a house are working and you will be part of the last finish. We will decorate, make paths in our garden between all our suistainible houses, paint etc. We will also be working establishing a herb garden</descr_partner><descr_work>In the middle of our ‘’park garden’’ we have allocated an area for organic gardening.  Therefore, you should expect to work with garden tools building up parts of the area. It could be by making raised beds for herbs and flowers. Water channels for watering, digging a chamber in the ground for keeping vegetables during winter. Natural shade for plants and people. Etc.  THEREFORE, it is garden work - all done by an environmental way, using nature, for the nature!
 
However, the main work will be to assist finishing the Off grid house. Later the greenhouse will be used as a classroom for making slow food and for yoga and meditation, - and of course for flowers and plants.
 
The area of the new ‘organic herb world’ is approximately 1000 square meters.
 
Our garden is consisting of some very spectacular old trees, and together with the imposing structure of the straw bale house and the music house, the Lotus House and the Tree Top House, we have a wonderful world.  We would like to link the buildings together with our new organic garden and build pass ways between them.
 
During camp, we will take time to debate sustainability - not only as an environmental issue but also on all levels - including sustainability among people and cultures.</descr_work><descr_accomodation_and_food>Sleeping:

Thus Stevns Klint is not only a special place for research, but also an important place for the dissemination of Earth and life history. Stevns Klint was last year visited by more than 115.000 visitors. 

Stevns is a peninsula bounded by the Baltic Sea. The steep cliffs of chalk and limestone rises up to 40 meters above sea level on a stretch of over 16 kilometers. During the Cold War Stevns played an important role as NATO's strategic outpost to the east. Several military facilities are now available to the public - including the significant 'Stevns Fortress' with underground listenings installations.

The Festival is arranged by 4 employees with the overall responsibility, and 4000 volunteers, who are aged from 13 to 70 years of age. Nibe Festival is the 6. Largest music festival in Denmark. It includes music of all sorts, but mostly Pop and Rock spread out on more than 100 concerts during the entire festival. There are 5 different stages which have different target groups. 

The enthusiasm, team spirit and good humor is the main reason why people return year by year to volunteer and work at the festival.  We work hard to make an exceptional festival for our guests - but we have a lot of fun and great times doing it.

During the Festival, 15.000 guests daily come to visit the forest, 
which makes Nibe one of the most intimate and beautiful music Festivals in Denmark. It is located out in a forest called Skal Skoven which gives a real special vibe and it is only 500 meters from downtown Nibe. Our guests come in all categories, from teenagers to grandparents bringing their grandchildren, and we are proud to offer a Festival that all of these people enjoy and attend simultaneously.

Nibe Festival is a nonprofit organization, and all profits are donated to local initiatives and to charity.

Last year (2016) Nibe Festival had their first Work Camp, which was a great succes.</descr_partner><descr_work>You will be a central part of Nibe Festival, where a team of skilled and dedicated volunteers are working.

The work will take place before and after the Festival where we will be in charge of building/putting up and taking down – Fences, tents, festival-bars, floors and much more - properly instructed by the practical coordinator.

Building up and taking the festival site is manual work and you will be a part of the Musik i Lejet site-coordination-crew. Experience with handtools (hammer, screwdriver etc.) is not a requirement, but definitely an advantage.  You will work as a Work Camp-group among other groups. In total there is 80-200 volunteers each day at the site, who mostly come from local cultural organizations or sports associations. The work you will be during shift from day-to-day, as the festival site changes. One day you paint, another day you set up a bar, the backstage, the stage and so on. 

As a part of the festival-site-coordination-crew we all work the same hours 9:30 am – 18:00 pm. There will be breaks during the day. Every day we eat breakfast, lunch and dinner together, and therefore we quickly get to know one and other. It gives you the opportunity to meet new people and get a lot of new Danish friends. We often refer to the site-coordination-crew as a big family – because there is a certain feeling of being part of making something become reality – and a feeling that we depend on each other.</descr_work><descr_accomodation_and_food>Sleeping facilities:

We are now doing projects for children and youngsters in Greenland, and for Greenlandic children, youngsters and their families in Denmark.

We have been doing work camps every summer since 2014. See www.fgb.dk (only in Danish)
Our first camp took place in Qaanaaq in 2014, and we are looking foreward to be returning til Qaanaaq this summer.</descr_partner><descr_work>Association Greenlandic Children wants Camp Avannaa to give the children of Qaanaaq the best summer ever. The activities will take place five days a week 12.00-18.00, and will fall into these categories:
-	Music
-	Dance
-	Photography
-	Singing
-	Games
-	Sports
-	A daily/weekly “newspaper”/info board about the activities of the camp

The precise activities will be decided within the group.
We value creative skills a lot on this camp, since the activities will be in form of dancing, singing, playing music, playing sports, doing theatre, telling stories, panting  etc.  These activities are much appreciated in Qaanaaq and both children and adults will want to participate. 

Once a week we will invite the entire population to a social event. This could be a night of music and dancing, teaching each other to play an instrument, cooking food from your home country, movie night etc.
You will only be given one day off each week; Sunday. On Sundays you are completely free to do whatever you want.</descr_work><descr_accomodation_and_food>Sleeping facilities:
You will stay at the school’s dormitory. Here you will share a bedroom with another volunteer (same sex).

You do not need to bring a sleeping bag.

You will share two washing machines. 

Kitchen + bathroom facilities: 
You share the living room and kitchen area, toilets and showers.
You will split up in teams and take turns on the responsibility for grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning.

Since Qaanaaq ia very far up North and they only have the cargo ship coming in 1-2 a year, the grocery store is very scarce. It can be very difficult to get fresh fruit and vegetables, but there will be plenty of canned food, frozen food, meat, fish etc. Therefore you should be able to adapt to these local conditions or bring a small stock of goods yourself.</descr_accomodation_and_food><descr_location_and_leisure>Qaanaaq is placed on a latitude of 79 Degrees North, far away from any other civilization.
Qaanaaq is now a midsize town in Greenland with 600 inhabitants. 100 of these are children at the age of 6 to 15 years. Qaanaaq is in many ways a well equipped town with a store, post office, school, kinder garden, church, airport etc. But in many ways Qaanaaq is also a very remote place. 

The nature in Greenland in general is amazing. But in Qaanaaq there will always be a risk of meeting a polar bear, why leaving town will take place whith somebody local to guide us. 

Hiking in the fells and the nearby glaciers is amazing and a unique experience. We will try to help you organize a weekly leisure activity going hiking, fishing etc. 

Hopefully the gym will be open for us around the clock. It will also be possible to play football or other sports with the community. Since Qaanaaq is on 79 degrees North, there will be broad daylight around the clock.

If you’re a runner a like to take a walk, it’s possible to go for a walk or a run on the road towards the airport… app. 4km each way.</descr_location_and_leisure><descr_requirements>IMPORTANT! 
Volunteers will travel as a group from Copenhagen to Greenland first by plane and then two times by helicopter to get to the Work Camp. You only buy ticket from your homeland to Copenhagen and back. Tickets from Copenhagen to Qaanaq will be provided but therefore you pay travel costs which will be subsidized in accordance to the home country of the volunteer.

Travel costs:
4000 DKK / 500 EUR for people from non-European countries
6000 DKK / 800 EUR for people from European countries
8000 DKK / 1000 EUR for people from Scandinavian countries

It is positive if you have experience with staying/living in secluded Communities. Qaanaaq is very far away from the rest of Greenland and the rest of the World. In Qaanaaq planes to the nearest bigger town is only once a week. It is not possible to sail to any bigger town. 
Being able to live without internet and scarce telephone connection is very important.
Food will mainly be fish and meet - but vegetarian food is possible as long as you are allright with eating canned and frozen vegetables.

You will be working with kids six hours a day, so you should find joy in spending time with children and know how to be patient with them. Most of the children do not understand English so you should be open to other ways of communicating. 

A motivational letter and criminal record is required.</descr_requirements><airport>CPH</airport><train_bus_station>Copenhagen Central Station</train_bus_station><numvol_m>6</numvol_m><numvol_f>6</numvol_f><max_vols_per_country>2</max_vols_per_country><max_teenagers>0</max_teenagers><max_national_vols>2</max_national_vols><lat_project>70.485278</lat_project><lng_project>-21.966667</lng_project><notes>Internet- and mobile connections can be very scarce.

With the help of Brandkadetter i Danmark the fire departments provide a 6 months’ firefighting education program for young people between the age of 10-18. The young fire cadets are typically 13-14, when they begin. The firefighting program focuses on fire related assignments, non-operational tasks and training, discipline, and community. After passing the program the fire cadets continue in the local youth firefighting department.  When they reach the age of 16 or 18 they can continue as volunteer firefighters.  

Brandkadetter i Danmark focuses on the inclusion of young people with different challenges in their lives. At least 50% of all educated youth fire cadets belong to this target group. Their difficulties in life could be social, personal or academic. 

This summer Brandkadetter i Danmark is arranging a summer camp for all youth fire cadets in Denmark. We expect about 200 participants -  youth fire cadets, firefighting instructors, and volunteers. We expect around 50 participants from Germany, that has a long tradition in educating youth fire cadets. 

The summer camp will take place on a little island in Denmark called Femø. The focus of the summer camp will be firefighting assignments and tasks, socializing, and fellowship.

Two years ago, a similar summer camp took place with great success. This year we expect twice as many participants, and therefore we need twice as many volunteers who want to give young people an unforgettable experience.

As a volunteer, you will have tasks in the kitchen, and you will eat together with the rest of the participants. There will be festival toilets and shower facilities. 

In Copenhagen you will have regular toilet and shower facilities.  Brandkadetter i Danmark will provide groceries and you will have access to a kitchen.</descr_accomodation_and_food><descr_location_and_leisure>You will spend your time on Femø from Wednesday the 28th of June until Sunday the 2nd of July. Since we will be working with the youth, alcohol, drugs and/or narcotics of any kind are strictly forbidden at all times also on the local fire station. Should this not be met, you will be expelled from the summer camp/programme at your own cost. 

In between the volunteering tasks on Femø there will be some spare time, so you will get the chance to experience the beautiful island. You are allowed to move freely on the island, which holds hills, a cosy yacht harbour, and beautiful beaches where you can swim. It is possible to rent bicycles (own cost). All meals will be consumed at the summer camp.

The day before and the days after the summer camp you will be accommodated in a local fire station in Copenhagen. Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark. The city has lots to offer; the great amusement park Tivoli, The Little Mermaid, the harbour area Nyhavn, where you can take a boat tour on the charming canals in Copenhagen and a lot of great places to eat and drink. Copenhagen also has a lot of green parks and beaches.</descr_location_and_leisure><airport>CPH</airport><train_bus_station>Copenhagen Central Station</train_bus_station><numvol_m>10</numvol_m><numvol_f>10</numvol_f><max_vols_per_country>2</max_vols_per_country><max_teenagers>0</max_teenagers><max_national_vols>2</max_national_vols><lat_project>54.972097</lat_project><lng_project>11.5303256</lng_project><notes>Please note that we will be outside the majority of the time on Femø.
