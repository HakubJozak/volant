= The Acts As Convertible To Csv

== Installation

To install or update the gem, simply execute:

gem install acts_as_convertible_to_csv

To use the 'acts_as_convertible_to_csv' library in your Rails application after installing
the gem, add this line at the end of your 'config/environment.rb' file:

require 'convertible_to_csv'

== Usage Instructions

:header may be true or false, or not given. :header => true means the csv output will have the first row as a header (with field names)
:fields should be an array of field names. If :fields is not specified, all the human_readable fields will be used.

In your model declaration:

  class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_convertible_to_csv :header => true, 
                               :fields => %w(id firstname lastname email_address)
  end

Getting the csv data from a collection of records:

  Customer.find(:all).to_csv

You can pass a block:

  Customer.find(:all).to_csv do |line|
    # write the line to a file or something
  end

You can also convert individual records to csv:

  Customer.find(:first).to_csv
  

== Testing

The test code requires a database. modify the test/config.yml to point to the database you want to use for testing (acts_as_convertible_to_csv is default). Creation of test table is taken care of by the test code.
