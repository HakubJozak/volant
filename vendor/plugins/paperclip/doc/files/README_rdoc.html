<p>
<a href="../classes/Paperclip.html">Paperclip</a> is intended as an easy
file attachment library for ActiveRecord. The intent behind it was to keep
setup as easy as possible and to treat files as much like other attributes
as possible. This means they aren&#8217;t saved to their final locations on
disk, nor are they deleted if set to nil, until ActiveRecord::Base#save is
called. It manages validations based on size and presence, if required. It
can transform its assigned image into thumbnails if needed, and the
prerequisites are as simple as installing ImageMagick (which, for most
modern Unix-based systems, is as easy as installing the right packages).
Attached files are saved to the filesystem and referenced in the browser by
an easily understandable specification, which has sensible and useful
defaults.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for <tt>has_attached_file</tt> in <a
href="../classes/Paperclip/ClassMethods.html">Paperclip::ClassMethods</a>
for more detailed options.
</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>
In your model:
</p>
<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_attached_file :avatar, :styles =&gt; { :medium =&gt; &quot;300x300&gt;&quot;, :thumb =&gt; &quot;100x100&gt;&quot; }
  end
</pre>
<p>
In your migrations:
</p>
<pre>
  class AddAvatarColumnsToUser &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      add_column :users, :avatar_file_name,    :string
      add_column :users, :avatar_content_type, :string
      add_column :users, :avatar_file_size,    :integer
      add_column :users, :avatar_updated_at,   :datetime
    end

    def self.down
      remove_column :users, :avatar_file_name
      remove_column :users, :avatar_content_type
      remove_column :users, :avatar_file_size
      remove_column :users, :avatar_updated_at
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
In your edit and new views:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;% form_for :user, @user, :url =&gt; user_path, :html =&gt; { :multipart =&gt; true } do |form| %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.file_field :avatar %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
In your controller:
</p>
<pre>
  def create
    @user = User.create( params[:user] )
  end
</pre>
<p>
In your show view:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= image_tag @user.avatar.url %&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:medium) %&gt;
  &lt;%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:thumb) %&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The basics of paperclip are quite simple: Declare that your model has an
attachment with the has_attached_file method, and give it a name. <a
href="../classes/Paperclip.html">Paperclip</a> will wrap up up to four
attributes (all prefixed with that attachment&#8217;s name, so you can have
multiple attachments per model if you wish) and give the a friendly front
end. The attributes are <attachment>_file_name, <attachment>_file_size,
<attachment>_content_type, and <attachment>_updated_at. Only
<attachment>_file_name is required for paperclip to operate. More
information about the options to has_attached_file is available in the
documentation of <a
href="../classes/Paperclip/ClassMethods.html">Paperclip::ClassMethods</a>.
</p>
<p>
Attachments can be validated with Paperclip&#8217;s validation methods,
validates_attachment_presence, validates_attachment_content_type, and
validates_attachment_size.
</p>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>
The files that are assigned as attachments are, by default, placed in the
directory specified by the :path option to has_attached_file. By default,
this location is
&#8220;:rails_root/public/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename&#8221;.
This location was chosen because on standard Capistrano deployments, the
public/system directory is symlinked to the app&#8217;s shared directory,
meaning it will survive between deployments. For example, using that :path,
you may have a file at
</p>
<pre>
  /data/myapp/releases/20081229172410/public/system/avatars/13/small/my_pic.png
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: This is a change from previous versions of <a
href="../classes/Paperclip.html">Paperclip</a>, but is overall a safer
choice for the default file store.
</p>
<p>
You may also choose to store your files using Amazon&#8217;s S3 service.
You can find more information about S3 storage at the description for <a
href="../classes/Paperclip/Storage/S3.html">Paperclip::Storage::S3</a>.
</p>
<p>
Files on the local filesystem (and in the Rails app&#8217;s public
directory) will be available to the internet at large. If you require
access control, it&#8217;s possible to place your files in a different
location. You will need to change both the :path and :url options in order
to make sure the files are unavailable to the public. Both :path and :url
allow the same set of interpolated variables.
</p>
<h2>Post Processing</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Paperclip.html">Paperclip</a> supports an extensible
selection of post-processors. When you define a set of styles for an
attachment, by default it is expected that those &#8220;styles&#8221; are
actually &#8220;thumbnails&#8221;. However, you can do much more than just
thumbnail images. By defining a subclass of <a
href="../classes/Paperclip/Processor.html">Paperclip::Processor</a>, you
can perform any processing you want on the files that are attached. Any
file in your Rails app&#8217;s lib/paperclip_processors directory is
automatically loaded by paperclip, allowing you to easily define custom
processors. You can specify a processor with the :processors option to
has_attached_file:
</p>
<pre>
  has_attached_file :scan, :styles =&gt; { :text =&gt; { :quality =&gt; :better } },
                           :processors =&gt; [:ocr]
</pre>
<p>
This would load the hypothetical class Paperclip::Ocr, which would have the
hash &#8220;{ :quality => :better }&#8221; passed to it along with the
uploaded file. For more information about defining processors, see <a
href="../classes/Paperclip/Processor.html">Paperclip::Processor</a>.
</p>
<p>
The default processor is <a
href="../classes/Paperclip/Thumbnail.html">Paperclip::Thumbnail</a>. For
backwards compatability reasons, you can pass a single geometry string or
an array containing a geometry and a format, which the file will be
converted to, like so:
</p>
<pre>
  has_attached_file :avatar, :styles =&gt; { :thumb =&gt; [&quot;32x32#&quot;, :png] }
</pre>
<p>
This will convert the &#8220;thumb&#8221; style to a 32x32 square in png
format, regardless of what was uploaded. If the format is not specified, it
is kept the same (i.e. jpgs will remain jpgs).
</p>
<p>
Multiple processors can be specified, and they will be invoked in the order
they are defined in the :processors array. Each successive processor will
be given the result of the previous processor&#8217;s execution. All
processors will receive the same parameters, which are what you define in
the :styles hash. For example, assuming we had this definition:
</p>
<pre>
  has_attached_file :scan, :styles =&gt; { :text =&gt; { :quality =&gt; :better } },
                           :processors =&gt; [:rotator, :ocr]
</pre>
<p>
then both the :rotator processor and the :ocr processor would receive the
options &#8220;{ :quality => :better }&#8221;. This parameter may not mean
anything to one or more or the processors, and they are expected to ignore
it.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Because processors operate by turning the original attachment into
the styles, no processors will be run if there are no styles defined.
</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
Before and after the Post Processing step, <a
href="../classes/Paperclip.html">Paperclip</a> calls back to the model with
a few callbacks, allowing the model to change or cancel the processing
step. The callbacks are &#8220;before_post_process&#8220; and
&#8220;after_post_process&#8220; (which are called before and after the
processing of each attachment), and the attachment-specific
&#8220;before_<attachment>_post_process&#8220; and
&#8220;after_<attachment>_post_process&#8220;. The callbacks are intended
to be as close to normal ActiveRecord callbacks as possible, so if you
return false (specifically
</p>
<ul>
<li>returning nil is not the same) in a before_ filter, the post processing
step

</li>
</ul>
<p>
will halt. Returning false in an after_ filter will not halt anything, but
you can access the model and the attachment if necessary.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Post processing will not even <b>start</b> if the attachment is not
valid according to the validations. Your callbacks and processors will
<b>only</b> be called with valid attachments.
</p>
