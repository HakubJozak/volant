## How can I use it?

Volant is open source and you can use or modify it for free. If you
need some help to set it up, think about some adjustment or just
wonder if it fits your organization, <a

Otherwise, install it on premise <a

repo</span></a>. It should not be very hard if know your way around
Ruby on Rails, web applications or just Linux in general. Good luck!
